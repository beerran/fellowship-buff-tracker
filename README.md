# LIMITATIONS

- **I have only tested this on 2560x1440 with resolution scale set to 100**
- **Your buffs ingame has to be 64px in height and width**
- **Buff images should be 60x60px - will rescale if larger/smaller**: Use clear PNG screenshots of individual buff icons - can be found on Icy-Veins/Method/other sites
- **It will mess up**
  - It will flicker sometimes/be out of sync for a second
  - I don't care that it's wonky
